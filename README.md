# Project Title: The Matrix
*File Name - Face_Recognition_Matrix*

## Description of the project:
Our project is a creative look at diving into the Matrix, using facial recognition security we are fighting back against the rise of AI. 

## Instructions for use:
To get our project up and running, you will make sure you have Minim, OpenCV and Video Library for Processing 4 imported into the file. Also make sure to include ```import java.awt.*;``` (you do not need to import anything from the processing library for this). A working webcam is also necessary for our project. 

## How it works:

List of classes/assets in the project and whether made yourself or modified or if its from a source, please give the reference

MyClass1.cs	Modified from reference
MyClass2.cs	From reference

# What I am most proud of in the assignment:
## Luke:
I am most proud of learning how to use open.cv and processing video for this project so I could make the facial regonition authentication. 
It was also quite enjoyable setting up the sketch to have a security system using booleans.
```Java
if(camScan == true && delayEnd == false)
  {
    delay(5000);
    
    translate(0, 0, 20);
    fill(0);
    rect(200, 450, 600, 100);
    
    textSize(30);
    fill(70, 255, 255);
    text(cont, 210, 520);
    delayEnd = true;
  }
```
I enjoyed working through the problems that arose when trying to do certain things, and I often found myself working on a problem without noticing the time flying by, simply because I was enjoying testing things out and seeing what worked and what looked good for the project.
I ended up choosing with 'Enter The Dragon' by BLK for my song because i thought it let the visualizer show its full range of motion very well.
## Evan:
I most enjoyed picking out the song and matching the visuals to it. I ended up choosing "Thunderstruck" by AC/DC and I used a lightning bolt symbol to match the theme. I also changed the colours to match the original album cover that Thunderstruck was included in, along with yellow for the lightning.
I also am quite proud of how much more comfortable I have become with processing and coding in general after dealing with many many issues over the course of the project.
